## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Custom font: Bai Jamjuree

### What I learned

- Using Tailwind's utility classes to build a clean, responsive layout quickly

- Applying mobile-first design by leveraging Tailwind's responsive prefixes

- Implementing background images conditionally (mobile vs desktop) using Tailwind

- Using utility-first classes like translate-x, max-w-xl, leading-relaxed to control layout and spacing effectively

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore using Tailwind plugins and customizing the Tailwind config more deeply

- Enhance accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA tags, etc.)

- Animate elements with Tailwind's transition classes or additional libraries

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) – The official docs helped me understand responsive classes and utilities
